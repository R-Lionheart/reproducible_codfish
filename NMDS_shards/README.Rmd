## Motivation

NMDS's are very nice for multidimensional data, but visualizing them can often be an absolute pain because the `vegan` package doesn't play nicely with other plotting libraries and often hides its output in complicated objects. Nonetheless, we often want to visualize the output in a friendly way.

Here, I mean "friendly" as in axes of MDS1 and MDS2, colored by some explanatory environmental factor, and replicates connected together. This often creates a "shattered" look to the plot so I've called them NMDS shard plots.
