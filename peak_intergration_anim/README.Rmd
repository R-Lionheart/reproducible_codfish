## Motivation

Understanding where MS data comes from is often tricky for people who haven't seen a Skyline tutorial or manually integrated peaks, but it's a key part of understanding the data that I find myself often needing to explain. The goal here is to create a visually compelling example of what "peak area" means and how the values we obtain from the mass-spec correspond to the values we mention in our papers.

To do this, I'd like to animate data points "appearing" as if the mass-spec was actually scanning and synchronize a boxplot of the peak area over time.
