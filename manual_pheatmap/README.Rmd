```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Motivation
Metabolomics sometimes involves looking at lots and lots of compounds, so what better way to do that than with a heatmap? Especially if the compounds can be clustered so that clear trends with an organizing them are visible. `pheatmap` does this reasonably well but doesn't give me the fine control I'd like, so instead I've recreated those heatmaps in ggplot.
